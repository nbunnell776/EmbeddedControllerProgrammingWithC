* History
* V1.0	30-March-2017		MB1297C BOM (initial BOM)
* V2.0	21-June-2017		MB1297D BOM    
******************************************************************************
* 
* Update for revision D:
*
* - No BOM changes compared to the MB1297 C-01 BOM, 
* ie C53 = 10pF, C71 = 10pF and STSAFE-A100 (U9 component) not fitted.
* 
* - Two pcb changes compared to the MB1297 C-01 pcb:
* 	° The reset connexion between STM32L4 and the ST-LINK MCU (STM32F103) 
*	is implemented of the MB1297 rev D
*	° The pcb below the Wi-Fi antenna has been removed to have more Wi-Fi 
*	radiated output power
* 
*
* Important note: Note: Firmware revision inside the Wi-Fi module must be: C3.5.2.3.BETA9.
* The Wi-Fi module maximum output power is then limited to 9 dBm to fulfill FCC/IC/CE requirements
